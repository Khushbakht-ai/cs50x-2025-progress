# 💻 CS50x – Problem Set 1 (pset1)

This repository contains my solutions to **Problem Set 1 (pset1)** from the prestigious [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) course by Harvard University.  
Each program in this set explores foundational programming concepts in C through real-world inspired problems.

## 📂 Contents

| Program         | File Name        | Description |
|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| 👋 Hello World  | `hello.c`        | Prints a friendly greeting to the user. |
| 🧱 Mario (Less) | `mario_less.c`   | Generates a right-aligned half-pyramid using hashes. |
| 🧱 Mario (More) | `mario_more.c`   | Creates a double half-pyramid similar to those in Mario games. |
| 💰 Cash         | `cash.c`         | Calculates the minimum number of coins needed for a given amount of change using a greedy algorithm. |
| 💳 Credit       | `credit.c`       | Validates credit card numbers using Luhn’s algorithm and identifies the card type. |
