# 🎮 Abby's Mind Reader – CS50x Pset0 (Scratch)

This is my first project for Harvard's CS50x Problem Set 0 — a guessing game built in Scratch, named **"Abby's Mind Reader"**. 🌟

---

## 🧠 Game Idea
In this game, the player has to guess a secret number between **1 to 10** within **3 tries**. The game provides fun visual feedback with characters, sounds, and backdrops.

## 🎨 Sprites Used

| Sprite No. | Name         | Purpose |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| Sprite 1   | Title Text   | Displays “Welcome to Abby's Mind Reader” |
| Sprite 2   | Play Button  | Takes player to the guessing part |
| Sprite 3   | Elephant     | Animated during guessing phase |
| Sprite 4   | Abby         | Generates secret number and interacts |
| Sprite 5   | You Win      | Shows up when player guesses correctly |
| Sprite 6   | You Lose     | Shows up when player fails to guess |

## 🎭 Backdrops Used
1. Theatre 2 – Intro screen  
2. Light – Guessing screen  
3. Spotlight – You Win  
4. Spotlight 2 – You Lose

## 🔁 Key Logic

- **Loops**: Used to repeat costume animations and checking guesses.
- **Conditionals**: To check if guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- **Variables**: `secret number`, `user guess`, and `tries`.
- **Sound Effects**: Guitar, cheer, and lose sounds added for feedback.
- **Parallel Scripts**: Say and speak blocks run together for voice + text.

## 💡 What I Learned
- Using Scratch's control blocks (repeat, if-else)
- Switching costumes, hiding/showing sprites
- How to build interactivity with simple logic
- Managing variables and conditions
