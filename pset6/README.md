# 💻 CS50x – Problem Set 6 (pset6)

This repository contains my solutions to Problem Set 6 (pset6) from the world-renowned **CS50x** course by Harvard University.

In this set, the focus shifts from C to Python, applying concepts like loops, conditionals, string manipulation, and file handling to solve real-world problems in a concise and readable way.

| Program           | File Name         | Description |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 👋 Hello          | `hello.py`        | Prints a simple greeting to the user. |
| 🧱 Mario (Less)   | `mario_less.py`   | Prints a half-pyramid of hashes with adjustable height. |
| 🏰 Mario (More)   | `mario_more.py`   | Prints a full pyramid of hashes, aligned symmetrically. |
| 💰 Cash           | `cash.py`         | Calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change. |
| 💳 Credit         | `credit.py`       | Validates credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm and identifies the card type. |
| 📊 Readability    | `readability.py`  | Calculates the U.S. grade level of text using the Coleman-Liau index. |
| 🧬 DNA            | `dna.py`          | Reads a DNA sequence and matches it to an individual in a database based on STR counts. |

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Translating C logic to Python while maintaining efficiency  
- Reading and validating user input in Python  
- String manipulation and control flow  
- Working with files, CSV data, and dictionaries  
- Implementing algorithms like Luhn's credit card check and STR matching  
- Using Python libraries like `csv` and `sys`

## 🎯 Goal

This problem set deepened my understanding of **Python syntax**, **algorithmic thinking**, and **file handling**.  
It demonstrated how the same problem can be solved in different languages while retaining core logic, and helped me write more elegant, readable code.
