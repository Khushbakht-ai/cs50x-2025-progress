| 🤖 Generative AI | The rise of AI tools capable of creating images, videos, and text |
| 🎓 AI and CS50 | How CS50 integrates AI tools like CS50.ai, built with Azure, OpenAI, and a custom vector database |
| ✍️ Prompt Engineering | Creating effective system and user prompts for AI, with a Python code example |
| 🧠 AI | Historical and current uses of AI in pattern recognition, recommendations, and games |
| 🌳 Decision Trees | Algorithms that make decisions step-by-step, as in games like Breakout |
| ♟️ Minimax | Game-playing algorithm that scores possible outcomes and chooses optimal moves |
| 📈 Machine Learning | Teaching computers through repeated trials, reinforcement, and the explore–exploit concept |
| 🧬 Deep Learning | Using neural networks to identify patterns and make predictions from training data |
| 📚 Large Language Models | Transformer-based models (like GPT) trained on massive datasets to predict and generate text |

🧠 Concepts Covered
