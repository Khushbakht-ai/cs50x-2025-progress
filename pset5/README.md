💻 CS50x – Problem Set 5 (pset5)

This repository contains my solutions to Problem Set 5 (pset5) from the world-renowned **CS50x** course by Harvard University.

This problem set introduced me to **data structures** such as **trees** and **hash tables**, along with **recursion** and efficient memory management in C. I implemented a family tree simulation and built a spell checker with a custom hash-based dictionary.

📂 Contents

| Program      | File Name          | Description |
|--------------|--------------------|-------------|
| 🧬 Inheritance | inheritance.c       | Simulates the inheritance of blood type alleles using recursion and structs. |
| 📖 Speller     | dictionary.c        | Implements core dictionary functionality for a spell checker using a hash table. |

🧠 What I Learned

- Recursively allocating and freeing memory using pointers
- Representing hierarchical data structures using structs (linked nodes)
- Understanding and implementing hash tables for fast lookup
- Writing custom hash functions to reduce collisions and improve performance
- Managing dynamic memory safely with `malloc()` and `free()`
- Improving runtime efficiency in search-heavy operations

🎯 Goal

This problem set strengthened my understanding of how **data structures** enable efficient computation. It pushed me to think about trade-offs in **algorithm design** and how to implement systems that scale well with large data (e.g., dictionaries with over 140,000 words!).
