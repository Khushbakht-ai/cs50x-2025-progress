💻 CS50x – Problem Set 4 (pset4)
This repository contains my solutions to Problem Set 4 (pset4) from Harvard University's CS50x course.

This problem set introduced concepts related to memory management, file I/O, image processing, and digital forensics using the C programming language.

📂 Contents

| Program | File Name | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| 🔊 Volume | volume.c | Adjusts the volume of a WAV audio file by multiplying each audio sample by a given factor. |
| 🖼️ Filter (Less/More Comfortable) | helpers.c | Applies image filters like grayscale, sepia, reflect, blur, and edge detection to BMP files. |
| 🕵️ Recover | recover.c | Recovers lost JPEGs from a raw memory card file by detecting file signatures. |

🧠 What I Learned
- Manipulating binary files using `fread`, `fwrite`, and file pointers
- Applying convolution kernels for image transformations
- Implementing edge detection using the Sobel operator
- Understanding memory layout and digital file headers (e.g., BMP, JPEG)
- Using structs and pointer arithmetic in real-world applications
- Practicing clean code organization and testing edge cases

🎯 Goal
This problem set deepened my understanding of low-level memory manipulation, digital media formats, and working with large data sets. It challenged me to think critically about file structures, memory safety, and algorithm efficiency.
