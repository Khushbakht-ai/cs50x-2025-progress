# 💻 CS50x – Problem Set 3 (pset3)

This repository contains my solutions to Problem Set 3 (pset3) from the prestigious **CS50x** course by Harvard University.

This problem set introduces the concepts of voting algorithms and data structures like arrays and structs, encouraging algorithmic thinking and deeper understanding of logic implementation in C.

## 📂 Contents

| Program        | File Name     | Description |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| 🗳️ Plurality Voting | `plurality.c` | Simulates a simple plurality election where the candidate with the most votes wins. |
| 🗳️ Runoff Voting    | `runoff.c`    | Implements the runoff (instant-runoff) voting system, eliminating the lowest-ranked candidate in each round until a winner emerges. |
| 🗳️ Tideman Voting   | `tideman.c`   | Applies the Tideman ranked pairs method to determine the winner without cycles, ensuring the election respects voter preferences. |

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Designing and implementing voting algorithms
- Using structs and arrays to manage complex data
- Applying sorting and ranking logic to real-world problems
- Understanding graph theory concepts like cycles (Tideman)
- Using nested loops and conditionals efficiently
- Gaining confidence in debugging and edge case testing

## 🎯 Goal

This problem set significantly enhanced my understanding of **data structures**, **control flow**, and **real-world algorithm design**. I now feel more confident in translating logic into working C code and breaking down complex problems into manageable steps.
