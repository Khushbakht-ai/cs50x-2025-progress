# 💻 CS50x – Problem Set 9 (pset9)

This repository contains my solutions to Problem Set 9 (pset9) from Harvard University's CS50x course.

This problem set focused on implementing **Birthday and Finance programs**, introducing concepts like data structures, sorting, searching, and algorithmic problem-solving in C.

## 📂 Contents

| Program | File Name | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| 🎉 Birthday | birthday.c | Reads a list of people and their birthdays, then prints all birthdays sorted alphabetically and allows querying for birthdays of specific people. |
| 💰 Finance | finance.c | Simulates a financial portfolio with stock transactions, calculating gains, losses, and portfolio balances. |

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Using **structs** to organize related data (e.g., a person’s name and birthday).  
- Implementing **sorting algorithms** to order data efficiently.  
- Searching and retrieving information from arrays and linked data structures.  
- Working with **input validation** and handling edge cases.  
- Practicing modular code organization and clear program logic.

## 🎯 Goal

This problem set strengthened my understanding of organizing and manipulating data in memory, efficiently searching and sorting, and implementing practical algorithms for real-world scenarios.
