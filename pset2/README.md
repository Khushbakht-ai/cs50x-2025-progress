💻 CS50x – Problem Set 2 (pset2)
This repository contains my solutions to Problem Set 2 (pset2) from the world-renowned CS50x course by Harvard University.

Each program in this set introduces encryption techniques and string manipulation, enabling deeper understanding of memory, characters, and algorithms in C.

📂 Contents

| Program           | File Name       | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔐 Caesar Cipher   | `caesar.c`       | Encrypts plaintext using the Caesar cipher technique with a numeric key.   |
| 🔄 Substitution    | `substitution.c` | Encrypts text using a custom 26-letter key through a substitution cipher.  |
| 📊 Readability     | `readability.c`  | Calculates the U.S. grade level of a given text using the Coleman-Liau index. |

🧠 What I Learned

- Implementing encryption algorithms (Caesar and Substitution ciphers)
- Validating command-line arguments and string input
- Mastering character arithmetic using ASCII
- Enhancing control over strings and memory in C
- Working with standard libraries: `ctype.h`, `string.h`, and `stdlib.h`

🎯 Goal

This problem set helped me solidify the foundations of working with characters and strings in C, and introduced me to algorithmic thinking through text encryption and analysis.

I’m continuously growing as a programmer through CS50x, and each challenge strengthens my logical and problem-solving abilities.
